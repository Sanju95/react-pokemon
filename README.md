# Creating Podekex for 1st generation Pokemon
https://pokeapi.co/api/v2/pokemon?limit=151

# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.\
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

# Requirements

- The app should start and bring back a list of the Generation 1 Pokemon names.
- The user should be able to click each Pokemon name in order to see a card with more
information for that Pokemon.
- The user should be able to close the selected Pokemon card and select another
Pokemon.

# FAQ
- Generation 1 consists of the first 151 Pokemon.
- We accept that the API calls will happen client-side from the APP itself - no back-end
required.
- We accept the APP will only run in localhost.
- When we select a Pokemon, we want to see its Height, Weight and a list of its ability
names
